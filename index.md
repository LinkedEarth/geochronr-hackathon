title: geoChronR online hackathon

## Virtual Workshop Date: February 8-9, 2022, 9am-4pm Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8)
This hackathon is all about bringing the power of emerging data standards, tools and community to all paleoclimatologists. This [LinkedEarth](http://linked.earth) activity, funded by the US National Science Foundation [EarthCube](http://earthcube.org) program (ICER-1541029), makes use of the [Linked Paleo Data standard](https://lipd.net) and the [geoChronR package](https://nickmckay.github.io/GeoChronR/) to introduce or advance your skills in age-uncertain data analysis. We published a paper in *Geochronology* last year describing the geoChronR package, it's [open and available here](https://gchron.copernicus.org/articles/3/149/2021/). 

This is the third geoChronR workshop, and the first that is online only, and builds on the paleohack series that we started last year as part of an NSF funded projet to bring more people into the LinkedEarth community (supported by NSF grant AGS 2002556 from the [P2C2 program](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5750) and will focus on **R tools for the analysis of paleoclimate data**, chiefly the  [geoChronR package](https://nickmckay.github.io/GeoChronR/).
As such, it assumes a level of _basic_ familiarity with the R data science ecosystem. Furthermore experience with:
* Age modelling software in R (e.g., Bacon, Bchron, Oxcal, Bam)
* Modern data science workflows in R [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
will be helpful

We stress that only basic familiarity is required, the kind that can be gained after a few tutorials. The hackathon will feature a mix of introductory lectures (on Zoom), R-based practicums, live Slack conversations, and finish with student presentations recounting what they have learned. 

By the end of the hackathon, participants will be able to:
* Understand the basics of paleo data structures
* Manipulate these structures
* Create age models in R using multiple algorithms
* Understand age model ensembles
* Conduct age-uncertain:
	* Correlation
	* Regression
	* Principal components analysis
	* Spectral analysis
* Generate publication-quality graphics
* Manage complex, reproducible paleoclimate workflows

## Overview Schedule

The hackathon will take place on Zoom. A schedule will be available [here] before the workshop (https://linkedearth.github.io/geochronr-hackathon/schedule).

## Participating

* The hackathon will be a combination of livestreams, live discussions, and slack conversations.
* The hackathon is organized around practicum sessions designed to get you started with the [geoChronR package](https://nickmckay.github.io/GeoChronR/).
* See our [FAQ](https://linkedearth.github.io/paleoHackathon/faq) for requirements.
* Register [here](https://forms.gle/XgsAEsW8PVCEPFME8) by **Jan 26, 2022**. Please do explain precisely why you are interested in this training, as we typically receive more applications than we can accept, and want to prioritize the most dedicated applicants.

## Support

The hackathon is free to attend and is supported by the National Science Foundation grant 2002556 (P2C2 program).

Initial funding for the development of geoChronR was provided by the National Science Foundation grant  EAR-1347221 (GeoInformatics program).
