# Groups
These are the working groups for the hackathon, your intrepid teammates as you begin to plumb the depths of time-uncertain data analysis. We hope you get to know each other a bit, have some fun, and support each other when the going gets rough. We did our best to put you in groups 1) in similar timezones and 2) that span a range of career stages and experience levels. Creating non-numeric group names is encouraged, but not required.
